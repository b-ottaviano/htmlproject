    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    The back half is really fun. It plays quite a bit longer than the front, offering a different feel overall. If you're looking to score, the back is where you want to make it happen. Four par 4's on this half, with hole 14 being the longest hole on the course. If you can create good opportunities 
    for yourself, you can potentially take it low here. I like the back half a little more than the front just because you're able to rip driver more often. It feels less like an executive course and more like a normal one.
    Key objectives for a successful back half:
    <ul>
    <li>Use the knowledge about your game you obtained on the front to guide you on the back. Play according to how you felt, and don't force it too much. These par 4's can really kill you if you aren't careful.</li>  
    <li>If you felt great with driver, <em>attack</em> the par 4's. If you aren't feeling as confident, set aside your ego and lay up with hybrid/3 wood/driving iron. Your scorecard will thank you.</li>
    <li>Take your time reading the greens. They seem a little trickier on the back. Some undulate, some are flat, some are fast and some feel really slow. Exercise your lag putting skills and secure a two-putt if possible.</li>
    <li>Take advantage of holes 10, 12, 16, and 18. Those are my picks for the easiest holes to score.</li>
    </ul>  
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 10</h4>
    <p>
    Hole ten is a pretty simple hole, with a few key things to look out for. The left side of the hole is the parking lot of the club house, so make sure you do NOT <br>
    hit this thing way left. Lefty golfers, definitely don't hit a shank here. Additionally, the right side is lined with water, so you don't really have much room to miss here. <br>
    A fairly simple, 120-ish yard hole to get your blood pumping again after a break in the clubhouse.   
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 11</h4>
    <p>
    Hole eleven is another fairly simple par 3. The left side is a wide open field that connects to a little park/tennis court near the tee box, so if you miss left you should be able to go and 
    find your ball. Missing right is okay too, with the tree-line hugging the 13 fairway. Be wary of the short-side bunkers lining either side of the green, otherwise you shouldn't run in to too much trouble here.  
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 12</h4>
    <p>
    Hole 12 is short and simple. The biggest trouble here are the bunkers short of the green. Other than that, the green is decently sized, and there is some room to miss right. Avoid hitting it too far left however, 
    because you'll probably be in the residential.  
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 13</h4>
    <p>
    Hole 13 is fun. It's the first of the handful of par 4's on the back. You can miss right, and go find it within the fairway at #11, but avoid going near the left side. There are lots of trees here, and <br>
    anywhere on the left leads you in a super tricky tree situation or even OB in the water. Realistically, there are two options here. Hit bombs and try to drive the green, or play a 150-170 yard shot off the tee and give yourselves a wedge in. <br>    
    </p>  
    <h4>Hole 14</h4>
    <p>
    Fourteen is my absolute favorite. Nothing much to say here except to hit hellacious bombs off the tee. If you play a slice, you will find that this hole can accomodate your shot shape. Same with a draw, it's all about 
    setup. Be wary on your second shot depending on where you land off the tee. There is a thin body of water that cuts the line of your approach shots, so you will have to choose whether to lay up before the water or try and go 
    over it. Both can yield success, but make sure you are careful not to hit into the water. I've had many times go south on this hole because I went for the hero shot over the water and hit a shaky shot in the water instead. 
    If you can make it in two, it should be a stress-free par at the least. Be careful of the many bunkers lining the right side of the hole on your approach.    
    </p>  
    <h4>Hole 15</h4>
    <p>
    This hole is a bit of a pain. Sharp dog-leg left, water cutting through some of the fairway. There are many trees on the left, and a road lining the left side as well. If you tend to slice, this hole may be trouble for you. 
    I try to either play driver or hybrid off of this tee, to get it around 200-210 minimum and give myself a good angle into the pin. The furthest part of the fairway should be around 260 or so, giving you the chance to hit a nice drive if you 
    can keep it in the center. With trouble on both sides and an uncomfortable dog-leg, this hole is one that is best played conservatively.   
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 16</h4>
    <p>
    The enjoyment of sixteen is entirely dependent on the pin location. If the greenskeeper is feeling nice, the pin will be in a nice and accessible location somewhere in the middle or left side of the green. If the pin is on the right, this hole 
    is a <em>pain.</em> Nothing crazy about this hole, but placing the pin directly behind the bunker means you have to either aim at the center of the green or go for broke and stick one close. The hole itself leaves some room for you if you go over, or right, but 
    avoid the left side because of residential yet again.   
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 17</h4>
    <p>
    Hole seventeen is the final par 4 on the course. A generous fairway, with not too much trouble on either side. Just pull out driver, and trust yourself here.   
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 18</h4>
    <p>
    Hole 18 is short and sweet. The green is pretty big, and there is a little bit of room on the long-and-right side of the hole. A few bunkers on the left side, one of which has a decent-sized lip on it. Stick this one close, throw a dart on the green, and finish your round with a birdie if you can! 
    Watch out for the bunkers here, the lips are fairly steep.
