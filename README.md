# htmlproject.github.io
An HTML  project to create a simple web page and style it using CSS.
Using HTML, I created a website detailing a simple strategy guide for Countryway Golf Course, highlighting one of my hobbies. 
Using CSS, I styled the web page to give it some design elements. 
The alternate design is a wonky and creative CSS design alternative.
