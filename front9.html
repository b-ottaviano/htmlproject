    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    This front half plays pretty short. Several of these holes are under 125 yards, so you have to make sure you're dialed in with your wedges. This course in general is all about managing the distance. <br>
    The scoring yardages make up a big portion of the whole course. We're talking 90-120 yards; those are KEY to finding success here. Be deliberate in your swing, don't underestimate the short ranges, and you should be all right. 
    Looking at the map above, water does come in to play fairly often on the front nine, much more than on the back. I find that the front nine is a little trickier because there's less room for error. If you're off with your wedges and short irons, you're going to 
    have a tough time because you'll be scrambling for pars all day long. <br> 
    Key objectives for a successful front half:
    <ul>
    <li>Play to your strengths off the tee - If you are great with a long iron (2 or 3), I encourage you to use them and find the fairway on the par 4's. They can quickly get out of hand and leave you with triple bogey.</li> 
    <li>Always check your yardages on the short par 3's. The tees often shift, so the sign is not always accurate. Knowing how far away the pins are is crucial to hitting good shots off the tee on the par 3's.</li>
    <li>Take advantage of holes 1, 4, and 6. I find these to be the easiest to birdie. </li>
    <li>Play it safe on hole 7, the highest handicap hole on the course. It's a tough par 3.</li> 
    </ul>
    We'll quickly go over my best tips for each of these holes.
    For the purposes of my guide, all of the tips will be based on the blue tees. 
    </p>
    <img class="puttinggreen" src="puttgreen.jpg" alt="puttinggreen"> 
    <h4>Hole 1</h4>
    <p>
    The first hole is fairly simple. A little over 100 yards, with sand traps all below the hole. My best advice here 
    is to make sure you don't go over the green. The hole sits up on a bit of a raised platform, and if you go over the back it will be tough to 
    stop the ball and secure your score. Clear the water off the tee, leave it short if you must, but don't take too much club and go off the back and you will be in a good position. <br>    
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 2</h4>
    <p>
    Hole number two is a little trickier. Woods surround both sides, and there are some thick bushes behind the pin. 
    The key here is, again, not to go over. You will end up either in a thick bush or on the third tee box, both of which are pretty bad positions. 
    The green is decently large, and a cart path runs up the right side as well. Stick one as close as you can and rely on your short game to secure a par here.  
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 3</h4>
    <img class="puttinggreen" src="hole3.jpg" alt="third hole">
    <p>
    Hole three is one of the tougher holes on the course, in my opinion. The left side is residential, so hooking it anywhere on the left side leaves you in some trouble,<br>
    or even OB. Usually I take driver here, but if you want to be conservative, a hybrid or a long iron would work great here. The biggest thing here is keeping your tee shot in play. <br>
    There is water on the right side, and a few fairway bunkers scattered along the fairway. If you can get it 200 yards off the tee at minimum, it will leave you <br>
    with a short iron or wedge in to the green and a potential shot at birdie. However, give this hole the respect it deserves and play smart. A wayward shot off the tee will <br>
    leave you scrambling for a bogey.    
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 4</h4>
    <p>
    Hole four is one of my favorites on the course. A short hole, but a great view over some water with a big green to work with. This hole is all about knowing your <br>
    distances. Short of the green will likely be water, or in some thicker grass with an uncomfortable uphill chip shot. Long of the green is yet another big bush, and beyond that <br>
    is the next tee box. Left of the hole there is a cart path, and a ways behind the hole is a little road. If you have to miss on this hole, miss right of the green, as you can still <br>
    give yourself a chance for an up-and-down. Throw a dart on the green here and give yourselves a birdie look; it's one of the easier ones you'll get here.   
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 5</h4>
    <img class="puttinggreen" src="hole5.jpg" alt="fifth hole">
    <p>
    Hole five is tough. The left side runs alongside a road, which always stresses me out (I like to wait for the cars to clear, juuust in case). The big dog eats on this hole, so pull out driver <br>
    and get some yardage off the tee. Be careful of the dreaded slice though, as you'll probably be in the water, dropping for 3. This hole is a sharp dog leg right. If by chance you can bomb it 275 off the tee, <br>
    you may actually be able to play a slice perfectly up towards the hole here, but for most of us, a good 200-230 yard drive will set you up well for a pitching wedge or a 9 iron into the green. <br>
    If you can keep it in play off the tee, this hole shouldn't pose too many issues. AVOID THE WATER!  
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 6</h4>
    <p>
    Hole six is the one that will get you if you don't respect it. You might think since it's only 70 yards that it would be super simple, but this hole is all about distance control. <br>
    I recommend using the clock philosophy for your wedges, and flighting a chip shot in there nice and gentle. The hole plays a bit like a bowl, with the tee box and the green elevated higher than <br>
    the short fairway in between. Hopefully, water on the right and street on the left won't come in to the equation. You <i>can</i> miss long but it's not as recommended as there are a few trees behind the hole. <br>
    Throwing a dart here can yield another elusive birdie, but make sure you really read your putts, because the green does slope and slant downwards at an angle.   
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 7</h4>
    <p>
    Hole seven is the highest handicap hole on the course. A longer par 3 with water in play on the right and left, this 200-ish yard hole is tough. Sometimes, the blues are moved up a bit and it plays more <br>
    like 175, which does make it a bit easier, but overall you might encounter some issues with this one. A bunker short right of the green can play spoiler if you hit a great shot off the tee, so watch out for that. <br>
    Overall, I like to just play this hole expecting to maybe walk away with a bogey. Pull out a longer iron and try your best to stick this one close off the tee and hope to get up-and-down.   
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 8</h4>
    <p>
    Hole eight is quite straightforward, with one main takeaway. Avoid the right side as much as possible. The left side of the hole is a big hill, with tee #9 sitting on top. If you miss left, you might catch <br>
    a good bounce and get yourself on the green, or you might even be up on the tee box if you missed that far. The right side is all water, and I've had far too many solid tee shots fail me because they started a little too right.
    Keep this one on the left side and you should be good here for a safe par.   
    </p>
    <h4>Hole 9</h4> 
    <p>
    Hole nine is fun. The left side is residential closer by the tee box but opens up pretty nicely as you go along the fairway. This hole can be played with driver, 3 wood, or hybrid, whatever you may prefer. <br>
    It doesn't play all that long, so anywhere inside of a 180-280 yard range leaves you with a gap/pitching wedge in to the green. Take advantage of this par 4, as it's the easier of the two on the front. I will point out that
    you <i>can</i> go OB right on this hole with a decent slice, but if you can clear the water off the tee like you see on the map, the right side are just trees that also line hole 2. <br> 
    I like to try my best on this hole and all holes to minimize my time near the trees, because you will likely be hitting off of some dead pine straw, so you never know how the ball will come out. Watch out for the short-side bunkers that can cause some trouble 
    and you should have another stress-free par or a birdie look if you're lucky.
