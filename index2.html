    <section>Countryway Golf Course is a short par 61 course consisting of 11 par 3's and 7 par 4's. 
      Located in Westchase, it has been voted Tampa Bay's <em>most affordable </em>  golf course.<br>
      This guide intends to serve as a caddy of sorts, breaking down the course in a way that will hopefully help you to produce lower scores and break your record.<br>    
      As a higher handicapper myself, I by no means claim to be the master of this course, but I've played it so much I feel as though I can pass along some wisdom. <br>
      Don't forget, golf is golf, and you can't always play perfect. <br>
      <br>
      My breakdown of Countryway:
      <table>
      <tr>
      <th>Pros</th>
      <th>Cons</th>  
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>It's one of the cheapest courses around</td>
      <td>It's often really crowded; sometimes you have to wait in between holes.</td>
      </tr>
      <td>Being so short, it's a great place to practice your short irons and wedges.</td>
      <td>A lack of par 5's can make it challenging to score and go low here.</td>  
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>The food at the club house is great and very affordably priced.</td>
      <td>Sometimes the course is not in the best condition, and some tee boxes can be a little roughed up.</td>    
      </table>
